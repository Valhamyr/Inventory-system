# Inventory Automation Research

This document explores methods for automating the addition of items into an inventory page. The goal is to reduce manual data entry and make it easy to populate the inventory application with information from external sources such as invoices, web links, or text files.

## 1. Processing PDF Invoices

Many suppliers issue invoices or packing slips in PDF format. The PDFs typically contain structured tables with item names, quantities, prices, and sometimes barcodes. To import data from a PDF invoice into the web-based inventory tracker you can use one of the following techniques:

1. **Client‑side PDF parsing** – Use JavaScript libraries like [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) to read a PDF in the browser. Combine pdf.js with an OCR engine such as [Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/) to recognize text. After extracting the table rows, map the columns (e.g., `Name`, `Barcode`, `Amount`, `Price`) to the inventory fields and automatically create new items.
2. **Serverless OCR API** – Services like **AWS Textract**, **Google Cloud Vision**, or **Microsoft Azure Form Recognizer** provide high-quality text extraction. You upload the PDF (via a server or a serverless function) and receive structured JSON containing table data. The returned JSON can then be converted into inventory items in bulk.
3. **Custom parsing scripts** – For invoices with a known format, you can write a specialized parser using Python libraries such as `pdfminer.six` or `camelot`. A small backend service could expose an endpoint that accepts a PDF and returns the parsed fields for direct insertion into `localStorage`.

## 2. Direct Weblinks

You can design web links that prefill or even automatically add inventory items when opened. A link could contain query parameters with all necessary data:

```
https://example.com/inventory.html?type=fabrics&name=Red+Cotton&amount=10&barcode=FAB-001
```

When the inventory page detects these parameters, it can either display a confirmation form or immediately insert the item. This approach allows integration with e-commerce or procurement systems that generate such links after a purchase. Additional options include:

- **QR codes** – Encode the link in a QR code printed on packaging or invoices. Scanning the code with a mobile device opens the inventory page with the item data filled in.
- **Webhooks/APIs** – If your supplier or store supports webhooks (e.g., from Shopify, WooCommerce, or custom systems), a backend server can receive item details and redirect the user to a prefilled link or call an API endpoint that writes directly to the inventory database.

## 3. Importing from Text or CSV

A simple text format is useful when you can obtain a list of items from a spreadsheet or an export file. Implementation options include:

1. **CSV Upload** – Add an import feature that accepts a `.csv` file. Use the File API in the browser to read the file, split lines, and map columns to inventory fields. Items are added in batch with minimal user interaction.
2. **Plain text copy/paste** – Provide a text area where users can paste lines like `Name,Barcode,Amount,Price`. Parsing is done in JavaScript and each line becomes a new item.
3. **Email parsing** – Some services can forward confirmation emails or shipping notices. A backend script can extract item lines from these emails and convert them into the text/CSV format expected by the inventory application.

## 4. Additional Automation Ideas

- **Barcode scanning with the device camera** – Modern browsers support camera access via `getUserMedia`. You can integrate a JavaScript barcode reader (e.g., [QuaggaJS](https://serratus.github.io/quaggaJS/)) to scan barcodes directly without a Bluetooth scanner.
- **Mobile app integration** – A lightweight companion app could push scanned items to a backend or directly to the browser's localStorage via the Web Share API or custom URL scheme.
- **Integration with ERP or inventory APIs** – Larger systems such as Odoo, SAP, or NetSuite expose APIs. You can connect to them with a small server to synchronize items automatically.
- **Scheduled imports** – For recurring data sources (weekly delivery spreadsheets, etc.), a script running on a server or local machine can periodically fetch files, parse them, and update the inventory store.

## Summary

Automating item entry improves accuracy and saves time, especially as inventory grows. The approaches above range from client‑side solutions that run entirely in the browser (for PDF or CSV uploads) to integrations with external OCR APIs and supplier webhooks. Depending on your technical constraints, you can implement one or combine several of these methods to streamline the flow from receiving documentation (invoices or links) to having accurate item records in the inventory tracker.
