# Inventory Tracker

A lightweight web-based inventory tracking application that works with Bluetooth barcode scanners and stores data in your browser's localStorage. Barcodes are rendered using [JsBarcode](https://github.com/lindell/JsBarcode).

## Features
- Manage multiple inventory types
- Delete inventory types from the home page
- Add, update, and remove inventory items
- Scan barcodes with a Bluetooth scanner or type them manually
- Data is stored locally in your browser (no server required)
- Barcodes for each item are displayed in the table
- Generate new item barcodes from the home page
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Default item fields include Name, Barcode, Amount, Material, Color, Store URL,
  Price and Notes. Material and Notes support multiline input.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to see a list of inventory types.
2. Create a new type or select an existing one to open its inventory page.
3. Delete a type using the **Delete** button if you no longer need it.
4. Use the **Generate Item Barcode** section on the home page to create a barcode for a new item.
5. On the inventory page scan a barcode into the **Scan Barcode** field or type it manually and press **Enter**.
6. Fill in the item details and submit the form to add or update the item.
7. Inventory items appear in the table where you can edit or delete them.

## Deployment
This project can be hosted on GitHub Pages. In your repository settings, enable **GitHub Pages** for the `main` branch (or the branch containing this code) and select the root directory.

## Importing Items from CSV

The invoice upload feature now accepts comma separated value (`.csv`) files.
Each row in the CSV should correspond to an inventory item and include column
headers that match your field names (for example `name,barcode,amount`).
When a CSV file is selected on the inventory page the items are parsed directly
in the browser and added to your local inventory. Header names are matched
case-insensitively to your inventory fields and common synonyms like `quantity`
or `code` are recognized automatically. Any barcode values present in the CSV
are ignoredâ€”the application always generates a new barcode for each imported
row.

The repository includes `mock_inventory_fabrics.csv` as a sample file that you
can use to test the import feature.
